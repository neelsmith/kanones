## Managing URNs

All citable data analyzed or generated by the morphological parser is expressed with URNs.


## Data sets cited by URN

- *collections of inflectional patterns*.  A core set of inflectional patterns from collections in the `urn:cite:gmorph` namespace is automatically included from `src/fst/collectionAbbreviations.csv`.  If you optionally add inflectional patterns by adding `.fst` files to the rulesdir directory (default: `data/rules-fst`), you must also register the collection abbreviations (see following section).
- *collections of morphological stems*.  Added to the stemsdir directory (default: `data/stems-fst`) either directly as `.fst` files, or generated from tables in the stemssrcdir directory (default: `data/stems-lexica`).  In either case, you must register the collection abreviations with the URN manager.
- *collections of taxonomic tags*.  Both morphological stems and inflectional patterns may be tagged with URNs identifying analytical concepts.  Add these in tabular files in the tagsdir directory (default: `data/tags`).


## Registering abbreviated URNs with the UrnManager

The SFST parsing engine uses an abbreviated form of URN notation.  URNs are expressed as multicharacter symbols, which are enclosed by angle brackets in SFST syntax, composed of the Collection identifier and Object identifer (that is, the object component of a CITE URN.)

Each collection must therefore have a unique collection identifier, and must be registered in a tabular file identifying its expansion into a full CITE URN.
