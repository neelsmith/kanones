This directory contains a template for a corpus-specific data set that can be used to build a parser.  the contents are organized as follows.


## Data tables

- `rules`:  the inflectional rules applicable to this corpus.  The eight subdirectories group the rules according to the eight analytical forms the parser recognizes (approximately congruent with "part of speech")
- `stems`: the morphological lexicon applicable to this corpus.  Note that there are six subdirectories, in contrast to the eight subdirectories for `rules` because the same entries for verbs are used to analyze conjugated forms, infinitives, participles and verbal adjectives, all of which are broken into separate analytical categories in the `rules` subdirectories.
- `irregular-stems`: additional, exceptional forms that cannot be generated by rule.


## Definition of orthographic system

The single file `orthography/symbols/alphabet.fst` written in the syntax of the Stuttgart Finite State Transducer toolkit <http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/SFST/>  defines the set of characters used in the data tables.

A default representation of literary Greek is included, and can be used without modification unless your corpus is in an epichoric alphabet.
