# Inflectional classes

Recognized inflectional classes are assigned a symbol in the FST alphabet.  This is defined in `src/fst/symbols/stemtypes.fst`.

Inflectional patterns and rules using a stem type are defined in the appropriate subdirectories of `${orthography}/${rules-csv}` and `${orthography}/${stems-csv}`.
