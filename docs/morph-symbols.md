The following strings contained by angle brackets are defined as individual symbols in the FST alphabet.

## Analytical patterns

Only approximately corresponding to traditional categories of part of speech, these categories identify eight distinct forms of analysis that can produced for a string:


-   `<noun>` Noun, identified by gender, case and number.
-   `<adj>`  Adjective, identified by gender, case, number and degree.
-   `<verb>` Conjugated verbal form, identified by person, number, tense, mood and voice.
-   `<vadj>`  Verbal adjective, identified by gender, case, number and category of verbal adjective.
-   `<infin>` Infinitive, identified by tense and voice.
-   `<ptcpl>` Participle, identified by tense, voice, gender, case and number.
-   `<adv>`   Adverb, identified by degree.
-   `<pron>`  Pronoun, identified by gender, case and number.
