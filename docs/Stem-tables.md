The directory `stems-tables` defines the morphological lexicon applicable to a corpus.

It has six subdirectories, corresponding to six forms of tabular entry.

(Note: This contrasts with the [eight subdirectories for `rules-tables`](../Rules-tables) because the same stem entries for verbs are used to analyze conjugated forms, infinitives, participles and verbal adjectives, all of which are broken into separate analytical categories in the `rules-tables` subdirectories.)

In addition, the directory `irregular-stems`has files for additional, exceptional forms that cannot be generated by rule.


## Verb stems

Verb stems are divided into two categories:  simplex verbs and compound verbs.

Both simplex and compound verbs use the FST symbol `<#>` to mark the beginning of the verbal morpheme.  Example: then stem for the first principal part of γράφω would appears as `<#>graf`, while the stem of the fist principal part of ἐπιγράφω would appear as `e<sm>pi<#>graf`.
